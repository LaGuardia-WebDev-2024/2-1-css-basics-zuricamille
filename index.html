    Leopards (Panthera pardus) are large, solitary felines known for their distinctive spotted coats, which provide excellent camouflage in their natural habitats. Native to sub-Saharan Africa, parts of Asia, and India, leopards are highly adaptable and can thrive in a variety of environments, including savannas, forests, and mountains. They are skilled climbers, often dragging their prey into trees to avoid scavengers. Leopards are primarily nocturnal hunters, preying on a wide range of animals, from small rodents to large ungulates. Despite their adaptability, they face threats from habitat loss and poaching, leading to declining populations in some areas.
